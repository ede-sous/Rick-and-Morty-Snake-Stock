# HIGHSCORE : 50 by ME -- Who Else could it be ??? #


# Snake with Rick and Morty has theme #

*Just git clone it, play with it and suffer.*
There is a Menu with Start and Quit, just press Enter in one of them, I think you smart enough to know what it will do.
However, you can Quit the game by pressing Escape.
In-Game you can Pause by pressing Espace or quit back to menu by pressing Escape;

# Now, there are some things you should know #

*The box can do different stuff, randomly !
The box can :*

`->>   Give you a Meeseeks                            == ' I'm Mr.Meeseks '`

`->>   Give you 3 Meeseeks                            == ' You gotta get Schwifty '`

`->>   Give you half of your current Meeseeks         == ' Wubba lubba dub dub '`

`->>   Give you a freaking speed boost                == ' Pickle Rick Remix '`

`->>   Give you a really fucking slow boost           == ' Tiny Rick Song '`

`->>   Take out one Meeseeks                          == ' Existence is Pain '`
